## Contributing to SouthHollow's Network Resource Pack

We're happy that you're willing to contribute to our network ðŸ’–

### Avoiding Legal Issues
Our talented internal team works hard to create this content for our players to enjoy. We want to protect their efforts, but also allow others to make meaningful contributations if they wish to. To solve this issue, in our [terms](https://github.com/South-Hollow/Resource-Pack/blob/main/TERMS.txt), we state that one must ask for permission before doing anything with the pack. Feel free to contact a staff member on Discord or open a GitHub issue where we can give you consent to work on it.

### Pack.mcmeta
You will need to update the pack's MCMeta file with the new version number. Additionally, please use the `pack_format` version of the lowest Minecraft release you wish to support.

| Minecraft version  | `pack_format` Number
| ------------------- |:-------------:|
| 1.17      | 7 |
| 1.16      | 6 |

If one were to make the pack support 1.16.5+, they'd use `pack_format` `6`.


This guide is a work in progress. Check back later for updates.
